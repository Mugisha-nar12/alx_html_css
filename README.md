# Headphones
This project implements a responsive web layout for a headphones-themed website. The core features include:

- **HTML Structure**: The HTML is structured with semantic sections such as a header with navigation and a "What we do" section showcasing features.
- **Navigation Menu**: A toggle button controls the visibility of navigation links on smaller screens. The button icon switches between a hamburger menu (☰) and a close sign (×) depending on the menu state.
- **Responsive Design**: The CSS uses media queries to adapt the layout for different screen sizes:
  - **Desktop (above 768px)**: Navigation links are displayed horizontally, and the toggle button is hidden.
  - **Tablet (up to 768px)**: Navigation becomes a slide-in vertical menu from the right, with the toggle button visible. The features grid switches from 4 columns to 2 columns.
  - **Mobile (up to 480px)**: The navigation menu covers 70% of the screen width, and the features grid becomes a single column for better readability.
- **Visual Styling**: The design uses a dark primary color for backgrounds and white text for contrast. Buttons and links have hover effects for interactivity.
- **Typography**: The font "Source Sans Pro" is used for a clean, modern look.

Overall, the code provides a solid foundation for a responsive website with a clean UI and accessible navigation on all devices.
